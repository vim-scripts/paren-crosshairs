The matchparen plugin tries to do a good thing; namely, highlight the paren that matches the one under the cursor. However, my friends and I found that having two parentheses highlighted always confounds our intuition about where the cursor actually is.

This plugin deals with this problem by setting cursorline and cursorcolumn when the cursor is on a paren.
